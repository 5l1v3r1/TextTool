A stellar explosion! Our Chandra X-ray Observatory data helps astronomers learn new things about a supernova and its remnant. Take a look: digital “clone” testing aims to design the longest-lasting, most energy efficient systems: 252P/LINEAR zipped by Earth on March 21. Here’s a look at the icy visitor from our Hubble Space Telescope’s view: KORUS-AQ #EarthExpedition is getting a close-up view of air quality over South Korea using aircraft, ground sites and ships. The multifaceted suite of data collected during this mission will help inform the development of the next-generation space satellites and ground-based systems for air quality monitoring and forecasting. Details: ice and safer skies! See how our satellites track volcanic clouds and improve the ability to detect and forecast the hazard to aviation: two Martian years, our Curiosity Mars rover is more than a geologist, scientist and explorer. It’s a weather reporter, too! The rover has recorded environmental patters through two full cycles of Martian seasons, which helps distinguish seasonal effects from sporadic ones. Find out more: dwarf planet with no name. Our K2 spacecraft pegs 2007 OR10 as the largest unnamed body in our solar system and the third largest of the current roster of about half a dozen dwarf planets. Details: SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific Ocean at 2:51 p.m. EDT today, May 11, with more than 3,700 pounds of NASA cargo, science and technology demonstration samples from the International Space Station. Learn more: pressure! Our Orion capsule passes series of pressure tests at Kennedy Space Center: 

The tests confirmed that the weld points of the underlying structure will contain and protect astronauts during the launch, in-space, re-entry and landing phases on the Exploration Mission 1, when the spacecraft performs its first uncrewed test flight atop the Space Launch System rocket.Full of science, the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft was released from the International Space Station’s robotic arm at 9:19 a.m. EDT: 

The spacecraft will return the final batch of human research samples from former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly’s historic one-year mission. These samples will be analyzed for studies such as Biochemical Profile, Cardio Ox, Fluid Shifts, Microbiome, Salivary Markers and the Twins Study. Additional samples taken on the ground as Kelly continues to support these studies will provide insights relevant for the Journey to Mars as NASA learns more about how the human body adjusts to weightlessness, isolation, radiation and the stress of long-duration spaceflight.LIVE NOW: SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft is set to depart from the International Space Station. Watch live: 

The Dragon capsule, which arrived at the station April 10, will be detached from the Earth-facing side of the station's Harmony module using the Canadarm2 robotic arm, operated by ground controllers. Robotics controllers will maneuver Dragon into place and astronaut robotic arm operator Tim Peake of ESA (European Space Agency) will execute the command for its 9:18 a.m. ET release.

Dragon will fire its thrusters three times to move to a safe distance from the station before being commanded to begin its deorbit burn about 2 p.m. The capsule will splash down in the Pacific Ocean about 2:55 p.m.In case you missed it: Our Kepler mission verified 1,284 new planets, of which 550 planets are small, possibly rocky and 9 new planets are in the habitable zone. The total number of known planets jumps to more than 3,200. Details: delivering almost 7,000 pounds of cargo to the International Space Station, the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft is set to leave the orbital laboratory with valuable science research and return to Earth tomorrow, Wednesday, May 11. NASA Television will provide live coverage of Dragon's departure beginning at 9 a.m. EDT. Details: #NAAMES mission is ready to set sail to study phytoplankton in the N. Atlantic for our latest #EarthExpedition. Learn more: our vantage point, the sun seems like a still ball, but it really is teeming with activity. Eruptions called solar flares and coronal mass ejections explode in the sun's hot atmosphere, the corona, sending light and high energy particles out into space. The corona is also constantly releasing a stream of charged particles known as the solar wind. 

But this isn't the kind of wind you can fly a kite in. Learn why: announcement that our Kepler mission verified 1,284 new planets more than doubles the number of confirmed planets. Did you know that Kepler 'sees' distant planets through decreases in star brightness when planets pass in front: planet-hunting Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets—the single largest finding of planets to date: from Canadian wildfires is trapped in the clouds. It was seen by our satellites: at 1pm ET: Listen in as we announce the latest discoveries made by our planet-hunting mission, the Kepler Space Telescope. Details: addition to today’s #MercuryTransit, here are a few other things to know about our solar system this week: McMurray wildfire continues to burn & is seen by our satellites: case you missed it - here's the full #MercuryTransit. For more than seven hours today, Mercury was visible as a tiny black dot crossing the face of the sun. This rare event – which happens only slightly more than once a decade – is called a transit. Although Mercury whips around the sun every 88 days – over four times faster than Earth – the three bodies rarely align. Because Mercury orbits in a plane 7 degrees tilted from Earth’s orbit, it usually darts above or below our line of sight to the sun. As a result, a Mercury transit happens only about 13 times a century. The last one was in 2006, and the next one isn’t until 2019.Want to learn about the science behind today’s #MercuryTransit? Check out our Tumblr: leaves the sun's disk in about 20 mins during today's #MercuryTransit. Here's the transit so far:558)

Charles J. ForesterLet's say, we really do say freeze, then dissect a human a molecule at a time, and find a nanorobot cell design that suits what ever cell it replaces, and see how big or small this will be.  Personally, I think the CPU, needs to move to a geodesic compacted design using nano T Switches made from carbon nanotubes.  The problem with single atom gates and things of that nature, you can't determine that there's a problem before it's broken beyond function.  So, if you don't use enough atoms, isotopic law takes over and it will break.  The CPU, has to be buildable in three dimensional space but, size, hey, if you look at silicon, only a few atoms deep and a few atoms wide but, we haven't freed that from the substrate or tried folding it up.The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - DARPA brought its agency elite to the Pentagon today, explaining its technology programs to defense officials and opening up about the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge in August. #DARPADemoDay__________________________________

PAUL McCARTNEY is the best!!! *-*History has shown that new technologies have the power to be both a positive and destructive force for humanity. It is imperative that the new technologies being developed for space are monitored and regulated.

My name is Darren McMahon and I’m being targeted with satellite D.E.W.’s (directed energy weapons). I believe I’m being targeted for experimentation purposes. This satellite D.E.W. targeting is most probably being performed by an entity within D.A.R.P.A. (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and/or the N.R.O. (National Reconnaissance Office) and U.S. defense corporations.

I am being targeted with concentrated directed energy, possibly microwave, in the form of a narrow beam and/or laser. Multiple times throughout the day, I will experience either a painful burning sensation on the top of my head, or the painful sensation of a pin/nail entering the top of my head, both of which are followed by pain within my head, and a feeling of sickness and weakness throughout my body. The pain and sickness I experience following each D.E.W. hit to the top of my head varies directly with the intensity of the hit. This satellite D.E.W. targeting of me has been physical and mental torture. It causes me pain and sickness many times throughout my day and depresses my mood. It has isolated me from my friends and family. I do not like to go out in public places such as restaurants, stores, etc. because I never know when I will be hit by the satellite(s).

I believe the purpose of this satellite D.E.W. experimentation is to see what short-term and long-term negative health effects can be produced by targeting humans. From my personal observations of the pain and sickness I experience following each hit to the top of my head, I believe it is possible for these satellite D.E.W.’s to cause strokes and cancers in humans. I believe this experimentation is also being performed in order to refine the use of these satellite anti-personnel weapons to the point where future targeted individuals will not be able to detect what is causing their pain and sickness. If this goal is achieved, these D.E.W.'s will likely be used on targets such as activists, journalists, and other people deemed as threats. I believe these weapons have the capability to slowly kill individuals with little to no trace of evidence.

These satellite directed energy weapons are a serious threat to our democracy and human rights on our planet. They are silent and invisible, and therefore not easily detectable. They employ laser technology which allow their operators to target specific individuals, without detection by others, even when in close proximity to the targeted individual.

TECHNOLOGY DAY, 11 may 
an explosive week as we delve into one of the hottest topics of today: virtual reality. 
Here's a conversation that will get you ready for the whirlwind ride that we have lined up for you this week!
Help us with feedback to you! Thank you!
In science, there exists a uniquely potent partnership between theory and engineering. It's what's given us atomic energy, the Large Hadron Collider, and space-flight, to name a few of the more headline acts. The theorists say: "This is theoretically possible." The engineers then figure out how to make it work, confident the maths is correct and the theory stands up.
These camps are not mutually exclusive of course. Theorists understand engineering. Engineers draw on their deep understanding of the theory. It's normally a pretty harmonious, if competitive, relationship.Yet occasionally these two worlds collide. The theorists say something is just not possible and the engineers say: "We're going to try it anyway - it's worth a shot." There is one field of science where just such a contest has been raging for years, perhaps the most contentious field in all science/engineering - gravity control. 
So - gravity control. 
Here, perhaps, the simplest explanation MGGF project (Modular Generator of Gravitational Forces). MGGF an unusual gyroscope that can fit on a tenth of the surface of your desk. If the rotor of any the power gyroscopes makes a complete revolution around the same axis of the cycle, then MGGF gyro rotor produces per cycle full swing around the three axes. This is its fundamental difference. It is designed for experimental verification of the holographic principle, and we will see how it functions. If the holographic principle works - the result is a direction of the gravitational force. Series of controlled gravitational forces leads us to of the operated gravitation and many, breathtaking practical results. No theories of gravitation, except the holographic principle, can explain the long-range action of gravitation or its alternative representation - the space - time curvature reason with masses. Long-range action gravity - is entered by "hands" - a gravitational field or a continuum curvature. Nevertheless, many physicists believe that gravity and space-time geometry are emergent. These results suggest that gravity and spacetime might be emergent concepts which may have a thermodynamic origin. Also,string theory and its related developments have given several indications in this direction. The holographic principle springs from the theoretical study of black holes, spherical regions. Theorists realized that a black hole has an amount of disorder, or entropy, that is proportional to its surface area. As entropy directly is related to information content, some theorists suggested that an information area connection might be extended to any properly defined volume of space and time or spacetime. Thus, crudely speaking, the maximum amount of information contained in a 3D region of space would proportional its 2D surface area. The universe would then work a like a hologram, in which a 2D pattern on the holographic screen captures a 3D image. But further need, answer the question: "Are you a supporter of the holographic principle -" yes "or" no "?". If "no", then I am afraid that our discussion would be meaningless.
So, unusual gyroscope MGGF. In the beginning, our focus is on the levitation of spherical and balanced rotor (MGGF) in a vacuum inside the spherical stator associated with the design. The vacuum allows us partially to thermodynamically isolate the spherical rotor from the influence of the external environment. Simultaneously with the levitation of the rotor is required to produce his oscillations under a control of a multi-core control system in accordance with parametric equations, which are recorded on the basis of the principle of least action. As a result, the rotor will oscillate coherently in vacuo. Coherent oscillations of the rotor mass in a vacuum leads to acceleration of Coriolis. This rotary acceleration perpendicular distributed a plurality of spherical surfaces of the rotor on which the plurality of moving masses around a fixed point - the center of mass. Rotary acceleration forms an interference pattern with six identical, fixed in each cycle of coherent oscillations diametrically opposite sites on multiple surfaces of the rotor, which are associated with fixed coordinates and accelerated observer. Thus, coherent oscillations of the rotor weight in a vacuum is a cooperative quantum phenomenon. According to the Holographic Principle, we can make a "projection" of six diametrically opposite to the rotor surface portions of the interference pattern at the cosmological horizon - in the "remote" holographic screen without loss of information. Strictly speaking, "projection" and is not required, if you understand that all phenomena, and so "the living" in this "remote" surface - the cosmological horizon of the universe (in accordance with the holographic principle), so I'm taking these words in quotes. We have ensured that there are six fixed identical and diametrically opposed portions of the entropy gradient on the "remote" surfaces (as, according to the holographic principle, acceleration related to the gradient of the entropy on the holographic screen), we see them as six white circles on a sphere, see fig. below. Then everything is simple. We can control the movement of four of the six groups of entropy gradient on the holographic screen with a rotor control system. In addition, the known large-scale anisotropy of the holographic screen. Approximately half of the entropy density (temperature gradients a relic radiation) on the holographic screen are different from each other so that two of the four groups of entropy gradient associated with the movement of mass elements have different interactions with these areas. Large-scale symmetry breaking on the cosmological horizon - the holographic screen and the result of the acceleration of the mass elements during the shift, lead to targeted entropic force that is applied to the geometric center (for a spherical rotor - to its center of mass, which coincides with its geometric center). According to the holographic principle, this change in entropy when moving the matter leads to the entropic forces that acquire the guise of gravity.
Fg = ΔTS,
Where Fg - the gravitational force, ΔT- temperature gradient at the cosmological horizon, S - the entropy caused by the movement of matter. After transformations we arrive at the second Newton's law, it means gravity control can be performed without exotic masses and energies.
If the holographic principle works, we can generate a number of areas of long-range forces (despite the fact that the holographic screen is "far" from us).
Newton's third law is not violated, since the size of closed system increases until the surface of the universe.
Physics gravity can get a new development, similar to that obtained with the optical transition from heat to the laser light sources.
If the force of gravity is an entropic force, there is no reason to look for a microscopic quantum theory of gravity or are searching for combining gravity with other microscopic forces. Furthermore, if the gravity is a thermal phenomenon, the particles can be expected vibrations around of the macroscopic equilibrium. 
A series of guided and directed gravitational forces allows a Nonreactive way to make the whole structure moving in space in any chosen direction. asteroid problem is to be solved, as well as many other problems too. For example, the establishment on the basis of MGGF project holographically - gravitational transceivers to enable the exchange of information at any distance without delay - the best promising direction "...the microscopic data on the screen can be done using signals that travel without time delay" - E. Verlinde.
The channel for such exchange of information is the holographic surface of the Universe - its holographic screen. There is an opportunity to communicate at a distance of tens of billions of light years in a holographic-gravity way without restriction with the velocity of light and without breaking laws of physics.
If there are advanced civilizations, they will use this channel of communication.“The vector equilibrium is the true zero reference of the energetic mathematics… the zerophase of conceptual integrity inherent in the positive and negative asymmetries that propagate the differentials of consciousness.” - Buckminster Fuller, Synergetics

64 tetrahedrons create 2 octaves of a perfectly balanced geometry called the Cuboctahedron or what Buckminster Fuller coined the "Vector equilibrium". According to the physics of Nassim Haramein, the 64 tetrahedron grid is the first harmonic of the cuboctahedron geometry and what eventually becomes, with scalar octave growth, the infinite holofractographic vacuum structure of the entire universe, as 64 is the fewest number of tetrahedrons needed to begin to see this geometric scalar fractal pattern emerge...

Here, perhaps, the simplest explanation project MGGF. For the levitation of the spherical rotor in a vacuum requires active management. This is due to the fact that is a need to produce an additional angular displacement of the rotor according to the points in the text of parametric equations (details in my site: www.isan.com.ua). As a result of the rotor will coherently oscillate in a vacuum. Coherent oscillations of the elements mass of rotor in a vacuum lead to Coriolis accelerations. They are uniformly distributed and perpendicular to the multiple spherical surfaces rotor's. Thus, we deal with the cooperative quantum phenomenon. Coriolis accelerations form an interference pattern with six fixed and diametrically opposite fields associated with fixed coordinates. According to the holographic principle, we can make "projection" them on the cosmological horizon - on "remote" holographic screen without loss of information. Strictly speaking, "projection" and is not required, if you understand that all phenomena "live" on this "remote" surface (according to the holographic principle), so I'm taking the words in quotation marks. We have ensured that have the six fixed the identically and diametrically opposite gradients of entropy are on the "remote" surface (because the accelerations are connected with the gradient of the entropy on the holographic screen), look a fig. below. Then it's all simple. We can move four of the six groups gradients of entropy on holographic screen by means of the control system the rotor. We know about the large-scale anisotropy of the holographic screen. Roughly half of the holographic screen entropy density is different from the other, so two of the four groups experience different interaction with these areas. The large-scale symmetry breaking on the holographic surfaces and our shift lead to a directed entropic force applied to the center of mass of the rotor. According to the holographic principle, it is a long-range directional entropic force caused by the movement of matter and there is a gravitational force. If the holographic principle works, we can make a series of long-range forces directed (because holographic screen "away" from us).
Newton's Third Law is not broken, since the size of a closed system is increased to the surface of the Universe.

Physics of gravitation might receive new development similar to that which optics received in a transition from heat to laser light sources.

If gravity is an entropic force, then there is no point in looking for a microscopic quantum theory of gravity, or in seeking gravity’s unification with other microscopic forces. Furthermore, if gravity is a thermal phenomenon, one may expect fluctuations around the macroscopic equilibrium state. This statement in the experiment.

A series of controlled and directed gravitational forces allows nonreactive moving of the whole construction in space in any selected direction. The problem of an asteroid is to be solved as many other problems AM AN ENGINEER, A PHYSICS PROFESSOR, AN ATHEIST, AND A FORMER (AND CURRENT) CANDIDATE TO THE US CONGRESS !!. 

You may find my campaign a bit peculiar, and -hopefully- interesting. So, if you enjoy reading ... here it goes! :-)

==========================

I had to run as an NPA (independent) 14 years ago (GE 2002, FL 22), because despite having been a democrat all my life, as a Democratic-Socialist I was being ostracized back then... I am:

1. An under-represented "authentic" foreign born (AFB), who moved to America at age 25 (and therefore one who will die with a noticeable accent on his tongue). 
~ Of the 17% foreign-born (according to the US Census) about 9% are “authentic” (that is, immigrated as adults, having done most of their education abroad). 
~ Because of their peculiar accent, AFBs are often not perceived as "fully American" and have minimal representation in the US Congress (only 3 such in our 535-member chambers). I have been in the USA 45 years and US citizen since the Bicentennial (1976).

2. As most scientists, I am a "distrusted" non-believer (those 2 who ever reached Congress being such, only disclosed their free-thinking after having been elected). Atheists/Agnostics have -so far- encountered an unfair "unbreachable barrier" to that goal of EQUALITY FOR ALL.

3. A Hispanic (who are very much under-represented, even in Florida). I was born in Vigo, Spain, and grew up there. I am a veteran of the Spanish Army (1969-71). My son Kelvin is a veteran of the US Army.

4. A Scientist (only 11 in Congress with that career [out of those 535 members])... 6 Engineers, and 5 other Scientists.

5. An open Democratic-Socialist ... only Bernie ... who else?

My experience in 2002 was exhilarating, yet sad. There was no room for any anti-establishment democratic-socialist to run a viable campaign. Yet, I tried very hard, and did quite well (given the circumstances).

What is different this time? Answer: SERENDIPITY! {S}

{S1} I was in a D.E.C meeting when it was announced that Rep. Patrick Murphy was vacating his seat to run for the US Senate. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to do an "encore". So, with quick thinking, I went for it!

{S2} I announced my candidacy 1 month before Sanders did his (for the Presidency). Yet, I was expecting that he would do that; and bet on it. Without Bernie, it would have been an effort in futility to convince my constituents that a Democratic-Socialist (and a Scientist) is what they need. Now I can run piggybacking on Sanders (coat-tails effect). Bernie is my spearhead!

~ So, I "qualified" for the ballot in record time and the hard way (collecting petitions), and the success doing that indicated to me that many people out there were quite concerned that -in these trying times (Global Warming, Sea-level Rise, Death of Estuaries)- we have very few scientists in Congress. 

~ The incredible success of Bernie is catapulting my campaign. According to social media, I am one of only 4 "Bernie-like Thinkers" in Florida (the other ones being: Rep. Grayson [running for the US Senate], Alina Valdes [FL 25], Tim Canova [FL 23]). I am in FL 18. Money starts to flow, and I am also expecting an endorsement -in early May- by the Freethought Equality Fund... there are currently 2 candidates in America running as free-thinkers. A first!

THIS DEMOCRATIC-SOCIALIST WELCOMES YOUR SUPPORT !!

EQUALITY FOR ALL !! … EQUAL REPRESENTATION FOR ALL !!
(Excuse my immodesty, but I have to say it like it is)
** This posting is about the "unique" campaign of J. XUNA !
=[1] ATHEIST
=[2] BERNIE THINKER 
=[3] HISPANIC
=[4] "AUTHENTIC" FOREIGN BORN
=[5] SCIENTIST
=[6] NON-PANDERING

~ IF INTERESTED IN DETAILS, PLEASE CONTINUE READING !!
~ IF NOT CURIOUS FOR MORE, THEN THANKS FOR HAVING REACHED THIS FAR!!
~ PLEASE COME BACK TO CHECK ON MY POSTINGS FROM TIME TO TIME. MANY OF THOSE WRITINGS ARE QUITE UNUSUAL (FOR A POLITICIAN TO MAKE).

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[1] First of all, I shall announce that, I am expecting the endorsement by mid-April of the FREETHOUGHT EQUALITY FUND, which is a PAC created recently by the AMERICAN HUMANIST SOCIETY, with the purpose of promoting candidates to Federal or State office who are firm believers on THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE !!

This PAC will be supporting the campaigns of candidates for the US Congress who are running openly as freethinkers, and those are: 
** Jamie Raskin (MA-8) and 
** John (Juan) XUNA (FL-18).

~ NOTE: Only 2 Atheists have ever reached our Congress, yet the first revealed he was Atheist only after being elected, the second came out of the closet after leaving Congress. They were:
** Sen. Pete Stark [CA], 
** Rep. Barney Frank [MA]

~ Despite recent polls indicate near 30% of Americans are NON-BELIEVERS (it is a much higher percentage of the millennials), yet the 'NON-BELIEVER BARRIER" HAS NOT BEEN BREACHED YET. As indicated, those who might be in that category, have not expressed so when running for Congress. 

[2] I'm one of the only 4 Candidates in Florida (for the US Congress) who are Bernie-Thinkers. Those are:
** Alan Grayson (running for the US Senate)
** Alina Valdés (FL 25)
** Tim Canova (FL 23)
** John (Juan) XUNA (FL 18)

[3] There are 15% of Latinos in Florida, with illegals (who let me remind you, they are also human beings) that percent goes to 20% (about). Yet we have little representation, in other words, very few Hispanic Congressmen, and -in Florida- sadly, all those are Republicans... whom we need to get rid of, sorry! :O).

The Latino incumbents in Florida are all Republican:
** (R) Mario Díaz-Balart (FL 25)
** (R) Carlos Cubelo (FL 26), and
** (R) Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (FL 27)

The hopeful Hispanics are:
** (D) Frank Perez (FL 27)
** (D) Alina Valdés (FL 25)
** (D) John (Juan) XUNA (FL 18)

[4] Regarding those who adopted America as their country, and who are not just FOREIGN BORN, but also did most of their studies abroad, arriving to the USA as adults (who then, will always sport a noticeable accent) WE HAVE 7%. I called them "authentic" FBs. If proportionally represented, we should have 37 such "authentic foreign borns" in Congress, but we have just 3, which is about 1/2 of 1%
** Sen. Mazie Hirono (born in Japan).
** Rep. Ted Lieu (born in Taiwan).
** Rep. Norma Torres (born in Guatemala).
~ I believe all came to America as adults, but not totally certain.

** If elected, John (Juan) XUNA will be the 4th (born in Spain).

~ According to the US Census, 17% of American citizens are Foreign Borns (that is, the so-called "authentics" + those born abroad who were brought to America when children).

~ NOTE: It is a fact, that "authentic" foreign-borns are often mistrusted. You have to be a Foreign Born who was educated in America since Kindergarten or Elementary to be totally accepted. If you come when teenager or later, you will not fit-in perfectly.
[5] How many Scientists we have in the US Congress?
The answer is 11 ! That is about 2% !
~ No wonder there are in Congress so many anti-Science, deniers of Global Warming. Including the science-illiterate Sen. Jim Inhofe, who is Chair (nothing less) of the Environmental Committee of the US Senate.

** As far as I know, I am the only candidate -currently- in Florida who is a Scientist.
Those 11 we have  graduated with the following careers:
~ 5 ENGINEERS and
~ 6 SCIENTISTS (3 PHYSICISTS + 1 CHEMIST + 1 MICROBIOLOGIST + 1 PHYSIOLOGIST)

[6] If you ever saw a NON-PANDERING Candidate ... look at me, please, I AM ONE SUCH !! A very rare breed of politician indeed! 

Please, WISH ME LUCK !!

There is always somebody who would sit next to me, though plenty other places are available and in such times my laptop/tablet and even cell phone, which is totally dis-connected (I mean wi-fi is off, data is off) would be so hot you can practically bake on it ☺.
