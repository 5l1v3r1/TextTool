hello saumya.
How are u.
the second half of ReviewList in listing 3.4.
After we declare our ListView and its data, we move on to the typical onCreate()
tasks you’ve already seen, including using a layout defined in an XML file C. This is
significant with respect to ListActivity because a ListView with the ID name list is
required if you want to customize the layout, as we’ve done. Note that the ID is
defined in the layout XML file; we’ll cover that in section 3.3.3. If you don’t provide a
layout, you can still use ListActivity and ListView, but you just get the system
default configuration. We’re also defining a UI element that’s used to display the message
No Data in the event that our List of reviews is empty D. We’re setting several
specific properties on the ListView, using its customization methods: whether the list
items themselves are focusable, how many elements can be selected at a time, and the
View to use when the list is empty
